dynamic handset database

•	The program “Mobile Database “ is designed to keep track of all the mobile handsets that were released till now. 

•	It’s developed in c++ programming language with the help of class, data file and functions.


•	It’s for those who like to keep a record consisting of mediocre details of a handset like its model no. , price, operating system, specifications and brand.

•	If further edited, this program can also work as a mobile selector that’ll help people to select a cellphone for themselves with all required features.

!! Also, this program was created in Turbo C++, with quite a variations in syntaxes and pretty outdated ones for that matter of fact. If anyone got any suggestions ( even stupid ones:p ) feel free to mention 'em.


Thanks
